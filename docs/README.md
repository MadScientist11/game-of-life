# GameOfLife
This is a pet project where I try various optimization techniques.   
It's inspired by this awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mNj3M1il_c).

It contains some level of abstraction so that it's possible to switch between different implementations with two enums.

# AlgorithmProcessing Enum
1) Simple 
2) Jobs
# RenderType Enum
1) Instancing
2) Instancing Jobs
3) Indirect Jobs

See also my Twitter thread, where I went into some details of implementing this.
